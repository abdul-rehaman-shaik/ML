# Employee Retention System

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict employee retention/attrition.

## Files

- `employee_retention_model.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the employee retention analysis and model training using stacking classifier.

## Overview

The notebook implements a stacking ensemble model to predict employee retention based on various employee attributes such as:
- Employee Number
- Job Role
- Department
- And other relevant features

The trained model is saved as 'stacking_clf.pkl' for deployment and prediction purposes.
